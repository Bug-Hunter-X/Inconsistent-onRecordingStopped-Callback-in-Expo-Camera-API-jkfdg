This bug occurs when using the Expo's `Camera` API with custom camera controls.  Sometimes, when the user manually stops recording a video, the `onRecordingStopped` callback is not triggered, leading to an inconsistent application state. This can prevent the app from accurately handling recorded video metadata or stopping subsequent actions related to video recording. The issue seems to be intermittent, not reproducible consistently, making debugging more challenging. It might be related to specific hardware or software combinations or a race condition within the Camera API.
